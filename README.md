<h1> 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning 📰 </h1>

📌 About the Project

This is a group project developed to detect whether a news article is Fake or Real using Machine Learning techniques. With the increasing spread of misinformation, fake news detection has become an important problem. In this project, we tried to solve this problem by applying different classification algorithms and comparing their performance.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify news articles
as FAKE or REAL based on their content.

📊 What We Did

* Collected and explored the dataset

* Performed data cleaning and preprocessing

* Created new features like text length, word count, and character count

* Converted text data into numerical format using TF-IDF

* Trained multiple machine learning models

Compared model performance using evaluation metrics and graphs

🧠 Models Used

We implemented and compared the following models:

1.Logistic Regression

2.Naive Bayes

3.Support Vector Machine (SVM)

4.Decision Tree

4.Random Forest

5.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

After comparing all models, Logistic Regression gave better and more balanced results compared to other models, so we selected it as the final model.

📈 Evaluation

To evaluate the models, we used:

1.Accuracy

2.Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

3.Confusion Matrix

4.Model comparison graph

These metrics helped us clearly understand which model performs better.

🛠 Technologies Used

* Python

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* Seaborn

* Scikit-learn

✅ Conclusion

Through this project, we understood how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems like fake news detection. By comparing multiple models and analyzing their performance, we were able to choose the most suitable model. This project helped us gain practical knowledge of data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.
